# Tik-Tok-Distributed-System-Approach

This is an approach to create a basic Tik-Tok implementation using the Distributed Systems theory.
There are some Broker nodes and some customers (Consumers) that are trying to watch different videos, like someone would do on TikTok.
Moreover, any user has the chance to create his own account/channel and upload his own videos.
Of course, the users can download their favourite videos and subscribe to their favourite channels. There is even a For You page.
